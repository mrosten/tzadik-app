# Rabbi Yisrael ben Eliezer (The Baal Shem Tov)

**Born:** c. 1698, Okopy, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (today Ukraine)
**Died:** 1760, Medzhybizh, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth

Rabbi Yisrael ben Eliezer, often called the Baal Shem Tov (or the BeSHT), is considered to be the founder of Hasidic Judaism. His teachings were based on two main ideas: the immanence of God in all of creation, and the idea that one's devotion to God is not based on scholarship but on a sincere love of God and a desire to cleave to Him.

The Baal Shem Tov emphasized the importance of joy in the service of God, and taught that even a simple, unlearned person could achieve a high level of spiritual connection through prayer, song, and a joyful heart. His teachings were spread by his disciples and continue to be a major influence in Jewish thought today.

### A Famous Story: The Baal Shem Tov's Pipe

The Baal Shem Tov was known for smoking a pipe, and it was said that he did so for the purpose of Kabbalistic meditations. Once, his disciples saw him searching for his pipe with great urgency. They were surprised, as they had never seen him so agitated.

One of his students, Rabbi Pinchas of Koretz, asked him, "Rebbe, why are you so concerned about a simple pipe?" The Baal Shem Tov answered, "It is not the pipe I am concerned about. It is the thought that for a single moment, a physical object could have any power over me. That is what I am searching for and seeking to extinguish."

This story illustrates the Baal Shem Tov's teaching that one must be master over one's own desires and not be controlled by them, even in the smallest of matters.
