# The Netziv (Rabbi Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin)

**Born:** 1816, Mir, Russian Empire (today Belarus)
**Died:** 1893, Warsaw, Congress Poland, Russian Empire

Rabbi Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin, known as the Netziv, was a renowned Orthodox rabbi, rosh yeshiva (dean) of the Volozhin Yeshiva, and author of several major Jewish works. He was one of the most prominent leaders of Eastern European Jewry in the 19th century.

The Netziv's most famous work is Ha'amek Davar, a commentary on the Torah that is known for its depth and originality. He also wrote commentaries on the Sifre and the Sheiltot of Rav Achai Gaon. As the head of the Volozhin Yeshiva, the "mother of all Lithuanian yeshivas," he had a profound influence on generations of Torah scholars.

### A Famous Story: The Netziv and the Russian Inspector

The Volozhin Yeshiva was a hotbed of Jewish scholarship, and the Russian authorities were suspicious of it. They sent an inspector to the yeshiva to see what was going on. The inspector was a very assimilationist Jew, and he was not impressed by what he saw.

He asked the Netziv, "Why do you waste your time on these old books? Why don't you teach your students something useful, like science or mathematics?"

The Netziv answered, "These old books are our life. They are what have kept us alive for thousands of years. They are what will keep us alive for thousands more."

The inspector was not convinced. He said, "You are living in the past. The world is changing, and you must change with it."

The Netziv replied, "The world may change, but the Torah does not change. The Torah is eternal, and it is the source of our strength."

This story illustrates the Netziv's unwavering commitment to the Torah and his belief in the eternal value of Jewish learning. It is a testament to his faith in the power of the Torah to sustain the Jewish people in every generation.
