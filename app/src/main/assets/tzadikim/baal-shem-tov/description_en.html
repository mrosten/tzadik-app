    <h1>Rabbi Yisrael ben Eliezer (The Baal Shem Tov)</h1>
    <p><b>Born:</b> c. 1698, Okopy, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (today Ukraine)<br>
    <b>Died:</b> 1760, Medzhybizh, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</p>
    <p>Rabbi Yisrael ben Eliezer, often called the Baal Shem Tov (or the BeSHT), is considered to be the founder of Hasidic Judaism. His teachings were based on two main ideas: the immanence of God in all of creation, and the idea that one's devotion to God is not based on scholarship but on a sincere love of God and a desire to cleave to Him.</p>
    <p>The Baal Shem Tov emphasized the importance of joy in the service of God, and taught that even a simple, unlearned person could achieve a high level of spiritual connection through prayer, song, and a joyful heart. His teachings were spread by his disciples and continue to be a major influence in Jewish thought today.</p>
