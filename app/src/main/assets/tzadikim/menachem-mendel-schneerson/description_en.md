# Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson (The Lubavitcher Rebbe)

**Born:** 1902, Nikolayev, Russian Empire (today Mykolaiv, Ukraine)
**Died:** 1994, New York City, USA

Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, known to many as the Lubavitcher Rebbe or simply the Rebbe, was a Russian-Empire-born American Orthodox Jewish rabbi, and the last rebbe of the Chabad-Lubavitch chasidic dynasty. He is considered one of the most influential Jewish leaders of the 20th century.

After assuming the leadership of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement in 1951, he transformed it from a small, insular group into a global movement, with a network of thousands of educational and social centers, known as Chabad Houses. He was known for his deep scholarship, his tireless devotion to the Jewish people, and his emphasis on outreach and education.

### A Famous Story: The Rebbe and the General

Once, a high-ranking Israeli general came to see the Rebbe. He was a secular Jew, but he was very impressed by the Rebbe's wisdom and leadership. He asked the Rebbe, "What is the secret of your success? How have you managed to build such a large and vibrant movement?"

The Rebbe answered, "The secret is that I am a servant of the Jewish people. I am not here to be served, but to serve. I am here to help every Jew, no matter who they are or where they come from, to connect to their heritage and to their God."

The general was deeply moved by the Rebbe's words. He later said, "I have met many great leaders in my life, but I have never met anyone like the Rebbe. He is a true servant of his people."

This story illustrates the Rebbe's profound humility and his selfless devotion to the Jewish people. It is a testament to his belief that the role of a leader is not to be a master, but to be a servant.
