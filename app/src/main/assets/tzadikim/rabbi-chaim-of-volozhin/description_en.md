Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin was a prominent rabbi, Talmudist, and ethicist. He was the foremost disciple of the Vilna Gaon and is considered the founder of the Lithuanian yeshiva movement.

In 1803, he founded the Volozhin Yeshiva, which became the model for all subsequent Lithuanian yeshivas.

His major work, Nefesh HaChaim, is a classic of Jewish thought.

### A Famous Story: Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin and the Vilna Gaon's Garment

Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin was a very devoted disciple of the Vilna Gaon. He studied with the Gaon for many years, and he was his closest confidant.

When the Gaon was on his deathbed, he said to Rabbi Chaim, "I have one request to make of you. When I die, I want you to take my garment and wear it."

Rabbi Chaim was very surprised. He said, "But I am not worthy to wear your garment."

The Gaon said, "You are worthy. You are my most devoted disciple, and you will continue my work after I am gone."

Rabbi Chaim promised to do as the Gaon asked. After the Gaon's death, he took the Gaon's garment and wore it.

This story illustrates the deep bond between Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin and the Vilna Gaon. It is a testament to the belief that the Torah is passed down from generation to generation, and that the teachings of the great masters are eternal.
