Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk was a Hasidic rebbe and one of the great early leaders of the Hasidic movement. He was a disciple of the Maggid of Mezritch and is considered one of the founders of Hasidut in Poland.

He is the author of the classic work Noam Elimelech, which is a collection of his teachings on the weekly Torah portion.

### A Famous Story: Rabbi Elimelech and the Poor Man

Once, a poor man came to Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk and said, "Rabbi, I am very poor. I do not have enough money to buy food for my family."

Rabbi Elimelech said, "I will give you a blessing, but first you must promise me one thing."

The poor man said, "What is that?"

Rabbi Elimelech said, "You must promise me that you will go to the marketplace and buy a lottery ticket."

The poor man promised, and he went to the marketplace. He bought a lottery ticket, and he won a large sum of money.

The poor man was so grateful that he came back to Rabbi Elimelech and said, "Rabbi, you have changed my life. I will never be poor again."

Rabbi Elimelech said, "I have not changed your life. I have only helped you to see that you have the power to change your own life. The lottery ticket was just a way of showing you that you have the ability to create your own good fortune."

This story illustrates Rabbi Elimelech's teaching that we all have the power to create our own reality. It is a testament to his belief that we are not victims of our circumstances, but that we are the masters of our own destiny.
