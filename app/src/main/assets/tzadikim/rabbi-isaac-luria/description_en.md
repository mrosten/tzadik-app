# Rabbi Isaac Luria (The Ari HaKadosh)

**Born:** 1534, Jerusalem, Ottoman Syria
**Died:** 1572, Safed, Ottoman Syria

Rabbi Isaac ben Solomon Luria Ashkenazi, commonly known as The Ari ("The Lion") or the Ari HaKadosh ("The Holy Lion"), was a foremost rabbi and Jewish mystic in the community of Safed in the Galilee region of Ottoman Syria. He is considered the father of contemporary Kabbalah, his teachings being referred to as Lurianic Kabbalah.

While his direct literary output was meager (he only wrote a few poems), his disciples documented his oral teachings. Lurianic Kabbalah became the dominant school of Kabbalistic thought, and has had a profound impact on all subsequent Jewish mysticism and thought. His system is based on the concepts of Tzimtzum (constriction), Shevirat HaKelim (the shattering of the vessels), and Tikkun (rectification).

### A Famous Story: The Ari and the Field of Souls

It is told that the Ari had the ability to see the souls of the departed, and to understand their spiritual state. Once, he was walking with his disciples in a field outside of Safed. He pointed to a certain spot and said, "Here are buried two great tzaddikim, but they are not at peace."

His disciples were astonished and asked him why. The Ari explained, "These two tzaddikim were great scholars and very pious men. But they had one flaw: they were arrogant. They believed that their scholarship was superior to that of their colleagues. Because of this, they are not able to enter the World to Come."

The disciples asked, "What can be done to rectify this?" The Ari replied, "If two scholars, who are humble and love one another, come here and study Torah together, their learning will ascend to the heavens and bring peace to the souls of these two tzaddikim."

This story illustrates the Ari's teaching that humility is the most important of all virtues, and that the love of one's fellow is the key to spiritual perfection.
