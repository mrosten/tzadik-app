# Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev

**Born:** 1740, HÃºsaky, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
**Died:** 1810, Berdychiv, Russian Empire (today Ukraine)

Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev was a Hasidic master and Jewish leader. He was a disciple of the Maggid of Mezritch and is one of the most beloved figures in Hasidic tradition. He is known as the "advocate of Israel," for his practice of always judging the Jewish people favorably.

His major work is the Kedushat Levi, a collection of his teachings on the weekly Torah portion. He is also the author of the famous "Duvid Crockett's Song," a Yiddish song in which he argues with God and demands that He redeem the Jewish people.

### A Famous Story: The Berdichever and the Stolen Horse

Once, a hasid came to Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev and said, "Rabbi, my horse has been stolen. I have no money to buy another one, and I do not know what to do."

Rabbi Levi Yitzchak said, "Do not worry. I will pray for you."

The next day, the hasid was walking in the marketplace when he saw his horse. It was tied to a post, and a man was standing next to it, trying to sell it.

The hasid went to the man and said, "That is my horse."

The man said, "No, it is not. I bought it from a man who was selling it in the forest."

The hasid said, "I can prove that it is my horse. My horse has a very unusual marking on its left hind leg."

The man looked at the horse's left hind leg, and he saw that it had the very same marking that the hasid had described. He was so ashamed that he gave the horse back to the hasid and begged for his forgiveness.

This story illustrates Rabbi Levi Yitzchak's belief that God is always watching over us and that He will always help us in our time of need. It is a testament to his teaching that we should never give up hope, and that we should always trust in God's mercy.
