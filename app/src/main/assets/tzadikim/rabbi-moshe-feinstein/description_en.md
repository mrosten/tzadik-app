**Born:** 1895, Uzda, Minsk Governorate, Russian Empire (today Belarus)
**Died:** 1986, New York City, USA

Rabbi Moshe Feinstein was a Lithuanian-born American Orthodox rabbi, scholar, and posek. He was a leading authority on Jewish law in the 20th century and was considered the Gadol HaDor (leader of the generation) by many.

He is best known for his series of responsa, Igros Moshe, which is a collection of his halakhic rulings on a wide range of issues. His rulings are known for their clarity, their sensitivity to the needs of the individual, and their application of traditional Jewish law to modern circumstances. He was also the rosh yeshiva of Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem in New York City.

### A Famous Story: Rabbi Moshe Feinstein and the Agunah

An agunah is a woman whose husband has disappeared, and she cannot remarry because she does not have a get (a Jewish bill of divorce). In the early 20th century, there were many agunot in Europe, as many men had gone to America and had never been heard from again.

One day, an agunah came to Rabbi Moshe Feinstein and said, "Rabbi, I have been an agunah for ten years. My husband went to America, and I have not heard from him since. I want to remarry, but I cannot. What should I do?"

Rabbi Feinstein was very moved by the woman's story. He said, "I will do everything I can to help you."

He then spent the next few months searching for the woman's husband. He wrote letters to rabbis all over America, and he even placed advertisements in the Yiddish newspapers. Finally, he found the woman's husband. He had been living in a small town in the Midwest, and he had forgotten all about his wife in Europe.

Rabbi Feinstein convinced the husband to give his wife a get, and she was finally able to remarry.

This story illustrates Rabbi Feinstein's compassion and his commitment to helping those in need. It is a testament to his belief that the Torah is not just a book of laws, but a guide to living a life of kindness and compassion.
