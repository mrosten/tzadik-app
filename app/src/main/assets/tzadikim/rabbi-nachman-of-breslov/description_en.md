# Rabbi Nachman of Breslov

**Born:** 1772, Medzhybizh, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
**Died:** 1810, Uman, Russian Empire (today Ukraine)

Rebbe Nachman of Breslov was a prominent Hasidic master and the founder of the Breslov Hasidic movement. A great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, he is known for his unique teachings, which emphasized a personal and emotional connection to God, the importance of joy, and the practice of hitbodedut (a form of secluded, unstructured prayer).

Rabbi Nachman's teachings are collected in works such as Likutey Moharan and the Sichot HaRan. He is also famous for his allegorical stories, which contain deep mystical insights. His grave in Uman, Ukraine, is a major pilgrimage site, especially during Rosh Hashanah.

### A Famous Story: The Lost Princess

One of Rabbi Nachman's most famous stories is "The Lost Princess." It tells of a king who has a beloved daughter, who one day disappears. The king is heartbroken and sends his viceroy to find her. The viceroy travels the world, searching for the princess, and finally finds her in a castle, where she is being held captive by an evil king.

The viceroy is unable to rescue her, and returns to the king with the sad news. The king does not give up hope, and sends the viceroy out again and again, each time with a new plan to rescue the princess.

This story is an allegory for the exile of the Shekhinah (the divine presence) and the Jewish people's longing for redemption. It is a story of hope and perseverance, and it has inspired generations of Jews to never give up on their dream of a better world.
