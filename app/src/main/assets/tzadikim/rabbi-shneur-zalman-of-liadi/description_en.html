    <h1>Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (The Alter Rebbe)</h1>
    <p><b>Born:</b> 1745, Liozna, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (today Belarus)<br>
    <b>Died:</b> 1812, Pena, Kursk Governorate, Russian Empire</p>
    <p>Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, known as the Alter Rebbe, was the founder and first Rebbe of the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement. He was a disciple of the Maggid of Mezritch and a major figure in the development of Hasidic thought.</p>
    <p>He is the author of the Tanya, a classic work of Hasidic philosophy that is the foundational text of the Chabad movement. He also wrote the Shulchan Aruch HaRav, a code of Jewish law that is considered authoritative by Chabad Hasidim. His teachings are known for their intellectual depth and their emphasis on the importance of understanding and internalizing the teachings of the Torah.</p>
    <h3>A Famous Story: The Alter Rebbe and the Czar's Minister</h3>
    <p>The Alter Rebbe was once imprisoned by the Czarist authorities on false charges of treason. He was interrogated by a high-ranking minister, who was a very learned man.</p>
    <p>The minister asked the Alter Rebbe, "Your Torah says that God is everywhere. If that is true, then why did God have to call out to Adam, 'Where are you?'"</p>
    <p>The Alter Rebbe answered, "The words of the Torah are not just for the past. They are for all time. When God said to Adam, 'Where are you?', He was not just speaking to Adam. He was speaking to every person, in every generation.</p>
    <p>"God is saying to us, 'Where are you? What have you done with your life? Have you used your time and your talents to make the world a better place?'"</p>
    <p>The minister was very impressed by the Alter Rebbe's answer. He realized that the Alter Rebbe was not just a simple rabbi, but a great and holy man. He ordered the Alter Rebbe's release, and he became a great admirer of the Alter Rebbe and his teachings.</p>
    <p>This story illustrates the Alter Rebbe's teaching that the Torah is not just a book of laws, but a guide to living a meaningful and purposeful life. It is a testament to his belief that the Torah has the power to transform the world and to bring us closer to God.</p>
