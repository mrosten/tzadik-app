# Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi (Judah the Prince)

**Active:** 2nd century, Galilee, Roman Judea

Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, or Judah the Prince, was a second-century rabbi and the chief redactor and editor of the Mishnah. He was a key leader of the Jewish community during the Roman occupation of Judea.

Known simply as "Rabbi" in the Talmud, he was the patriarch of the Jewish community in Judea and the first to hold the title of Nasi. His most significant achievement was the compilation of the Mishnah, the first major written redaction of the Jewish oral traditions known as the "Oral Torah". This work became the foundation of the Talmud and is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism.

### A Famous Story: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Calf

Once, a calf was being led to slaughter. It broke away from the herd and ran to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, seeking refuge. It put its head in the lap of the Rabbi and began to cry.

The Rabbi said to the calf, "Go, for this is the purpose for which you were created."

The calf went, and the Rabbi was punished for his lack of compassion. He suffered from a toothache for thirteen years.

One day, a weasel ran past the Rabbi's daughter, and she was about to kill it. The Rabbi said to her, "Let it be, for it is written, 'His mercy is upon all His works.'"

The Rabbi's toothache immediately stopped.

This story illustrates the importance of compassion for all living creatures. It is a testament to the belief that all of God's creatures are deserving of our mercy and that we should treat them with kindness and respect.
