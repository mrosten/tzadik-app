# Rabbi Yosef Karo

**Born:** 1488, Toledo, Crown of Castile (Spain)
**Died:** 1575, Safed, Ottoman Syria (Israel)

Rabbi Yosef ben Ephraim Karo, also known as the Beit Yosef or the Shulchan Aruch, was a preeminent authority on Jewish law. He is considered one of the Acharonim (later authorities) and is the author of the Shulchan Aruch, the most widely consulted of all codifications of Jewish law.

Born in Spain, he was forced to flee during the Spanish Inquisition, eventually settling in the mystical city of Safed. His magnum opus, the Shulchan Aruch, is a comprehensive and systematic code of Jewish law that has become the standard for Orthodox Jewish practice. He also wrote the Beit Yosef, a massive commentary on the Arba'ah Turim, and the Kesef Mishneh, a commentary on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah.

### A Famous Story: The Maggid of Rabbi Yosef Karo

Rabbi Yosef Karo was a very holy man, and it is said that he had a maggid, an angelic being who would visit him and teach him the secrets of the Torah. The maggid would appear to him in the form of a voice, and would speak to him for hours on end.

The maggid's teachings are recorded in the book Maggid Mesharim, which is a collection of the maggid's discourses to Rabbi Karo. The book is a classic of Kabbalistic literature and is studied by mystics and scholars to this day.

This story illustrates the belief that the Torah is not just a book of laws, but a living and breathing thing, and that there are hidden secrets in the Torah that can only be revealed to those who are worthy. It is a testament to the belief that the study of Torah is a mystical experience, and that it is possible to connect to the divine through the study of the Torah.
