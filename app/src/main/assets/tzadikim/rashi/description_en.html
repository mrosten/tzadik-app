    <h1>Rashi (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki)</h1>
    <p><b>Born:</b> 1040, Troyes, France<br>
    <b>Died:</b> 1105, Troyes, France</p>
    <p>Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki, universally known as Rashi, was a medieval French rabbi and author of a comprehensive commentary on the Talmud and Tanakh (Hebrew Bible). Acclaimed for his ability to present the basic meaning of the text in a concise and lucid fashion, Rashi appeals to both learned scholars and beginning students. His works remain a centerpiece of contemporary Jewish study.</p>
    <p>His commentary on the Talmud, which covers nearly all of the Babylonian Talmud, has been included in every edition of the Talmud since its first printing in the 1520s. His commentary on the Tanakh is an indispensable companion for any serious study of the Bible.</p>
    <h3>A Famous Story: The Wall of the Study Hall</h3>
    <p>It is said that Rashi's humility and the divine favor he found were evident in the very walls of his study hall. One day, a dispute arose between him and another great scholar, the Ri (Rabbi Isaac ben Samuel of Dampierre), regarding a complex point of law. As they debated, one of the walls of the study hall began to lean inward, threatening to collapse.</p>
    <p>Rashi, turning to the wall, said, "What is a dispute between mortals to you? It is not for you to decide the law." In response to his holiness, the wall straightened itself. However, the Ri, not wanting Rashi's honor to be absolute, commanded the wall to remain leaning. Out of respect for both great sages, the wall remained in a state of lean, neither fully upright nor collapsing, a testament to the power of their Torah study. This wall was said to have remained in that state for generations.</p>
