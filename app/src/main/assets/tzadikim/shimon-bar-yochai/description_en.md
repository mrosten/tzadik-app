# Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai (Rashbi)

**Active:** 2nd century, Galilee, Roman Judea

Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, also known by his acronym Rashbi, was a renowned 2nd-century Tanna (sage) in ancient Israel. He was one of the most eminent disciples of Rabbi Akiva, and is a primary figure in the Mishna and the author of the Zohar, the foundational work of Kabbalah.

According to tradition, Rabbi Shimon and his son, Rabbi Elazar, hid in a cave for 13 years to escape Roman persecution. During this time, they are said to have been divinely sustained and to have delved into the deepest secrets of the Torah. The Zohar is the product of these mystical revelations. His burial place in Meron, Israel, is a major pilgrimage site.

### A Famous Story: The Rashbi and the Roman Bridge

After emerging from the cave, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai was critical of the Roman authorities. He said, "All that they have instituted, they have instituted for their own needs. They have built bridges to collect tolls, bathhouses to pamper themselves, and marketplaces to place harlots therein."

His words were reported to the Roman government, and he was sentenced to death. He was forced to flee and hide in the study hall.

This story illustrates the Rashbi's uncompromising commitment to the truth and his refusal to be intimidated by the power of the Roman Empire. It also shows that he was not only a mystic, but also a man of action who was deeply concerned with the welfare of his people.
