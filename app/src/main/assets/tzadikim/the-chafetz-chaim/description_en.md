**Died:** 1933, Radun, Second Polish Republic (today Belarus)

Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan, known as the Chafetz Chaim after his famous book on the laws of slander, was a renowned rabbi, halakhist, and ethicist. He was a leading figure in the Mussar movement and one of the most respected Jewish leaders of his time.

His most famous work, Chafetz Chaim, is a comprehensive study of the laws of lashon hara (evil speech). He also wrote the Mishnah Berurah, a six-volume work of halakha that is considered an authoritative commentary on the Orach Chayim section of the Shulchan Aruch. His works are studied in yeshivas throughout the world.

### A Famous Story: The Chafetz Chaim and the Two Soldiers

The Chafetz Chaim was a very humble man, and he did not like to be honored. Once, he was traveling by train, and he was sitting in a third-class carriage with a group of simple, unlearned Jews.

Two Russian soldiers came into the carriage and saw the Chafetz Chaim. They did not know who he was, but they could see that he was a holy man. They said to him, "Rabbi, we are very thirsty. Can you please give us some water?"

The Chafetz Chaim said, "I do not have any water, but I can tell you where to find some." He then gave them directions to a nearby well.

The soldiers were very grateful. They said, "Thank you, Rabbi. You are a very kind man."

The Chafetz Chaim said, "I am not a kind man. I am just a simple Jew who is trying to do the will of God."

This story illustrates the Chafetz Chaim's profound humility and his belief that all Jews are equal in the eyes of God. It is a testament to his teaching that the most important thing in life is not to be a great scholar or a famous leader, but to be a good and decent person.
