# Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchak Horowitz (The Chozeh of Lublin)

**Born:** 1745, Łańcut, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
**Died:** 1815, Lublin, Congress Poland, Russian Empire

Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchak Horowitz, known as the Chozeh of Lublin ("The Seer of Lublin"), was a Hasidic rebbe and a key figure in the development of Hasidut in Poland. He was a disciple of the Maggid of Mezritch and Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk.

The Chozeh was known for his extraordinary spiritual insight and his ability to see into the souls of others. He was a charismatic leader who attracted a large following, and many of his disciples became prominent Hasidic leaders in their own right. His court in Lublin became a major center of Hasidut.

### A Famous Story: The Chozeh and the Two Brothers

Once, two brothers came to the Chozeh of Lublin for a blessing. They were both very wealthy, but they were also very stingy. They had never given a penny to charity.

The Chozeh said to them, "I will give you a blessing, but first you must promise me one thing."

The brothers said, "What is that?"

The Chozeh said, "You must promise me that you will go to the marketplace and give a gold coin to the first poor person you see."

The brothers promised, and they went to the marketplace. They saw a poor man sitting on the ground, begging for alms. They gave him a gold coin, and he was so grateful that he began to cry.

The brothers were very moved by the poor man's tears. They had never seen anyone so happy. They went back to the Chozeh and said, "We have done as you asked. Now, please give us your blessing."

The Chozeh said, "You have already received your blessing. The blessing of the poor man is the greatest blessing of all."

This story illustrates the Chozeh's teaching that the greatest blessing is not to receive, but to give. It is a testament to his belief that the act of giving charity can transform a person's life and bring them closer to God.
