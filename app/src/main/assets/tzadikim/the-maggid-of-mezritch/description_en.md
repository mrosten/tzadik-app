### A Famous Story: The Maggid and the Baal Shem Tov's Student

Once, a student of the Baal Shem Tov came to the Maggid of Mezritch and said, "I have been a student of the Baal Shem Tov for many years, but I have not yet learned how to pray."

The Maggid said, "What do you mean? You have been a student of the Baal Shem Tov for many years, and you do not know how to pray?"

The student said, "I can say the words, but I do not feel anything."

The Maggid said, "Go to the Baal Shem Tov and ask him to teach you how to pray."

The student went to the Baal Shem Tov and asked him to teach him how to pray. The Baal Shem Tov said, "I cannot teach you how to pray. But I can tell you a story.

"Once, there was a king who had a son. The son was very rebellious, and he did not want to obey his father. One day, the son ran away from home.

"The king was heartbroken. He sent his servants to find his son, but they could not find him. Finally, the king went himself to find his son.

"He found his son in a distant land, living in poverty and squalor. The king said to his son, 'My son, I love you. Please come home with me.'

"The son said, 'I will not come home with you. I am happy here.'

"The king said, 'My son, I will not force you to come home with me. But I will stay here with you, and I will share your poverty and your squalor.'

"The king stayed with his son for many years, and he shared his poverty and his squalor. Finally, the son's heart was softened, and he said to his father, 'Father, I am ready to come home with you.'

"The king was overjoyed. He took his son home, and they lived together in happiness and harmony."

The Baal Shem Tov then said to the student, "The king is God. The son is the Jewish people. And the poverty and squalor are the exile.

"God is with us in our exile, and He shares our suffering. And when we are ready to return to Him, He will be there to welcome us with open arms.

"This is the secret of prayer. When you pray, you are not just saying words. You are opening your heart to God, and you are inviting Him to come into your life."

The student was very moved by the Baal Shem Tov's story. He went home and began to pray with all his heart, and he found that his prayers were answered.
