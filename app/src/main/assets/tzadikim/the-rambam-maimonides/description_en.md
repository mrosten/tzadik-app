His major works include the Mishneh Torah, a comprehensive code of Jewish law, and The Guide for the Perplexed, a philosophical masterpiece that harmonizes Jewish theology with Aristotelian philosophy.

### A Famous Story: The Rambam's Eight Degrees of Charity

The Rambam is famous for his codification of Jewish law, and one of his most well-known teachings is his "Eight Degrees of Charity." This is not a story in the traditional sense, but it is a teaching that reveals his profound wisdom and his deep concern for the poor.

The Rambam taught that the highest form of charity is to help a person become self-sufficient, by giving them a loan, a gift, or a job. The lowest form of charity is to give unwillingly.

This teaching has had a profound impact on Jewish life and has inspired countless people to give charity in a way that is both generous and respectful of the recipient. It is a testament to the Rambam's belief that the Torah is not just a book of laws, but a guide to living a righteous and compassionate life.
