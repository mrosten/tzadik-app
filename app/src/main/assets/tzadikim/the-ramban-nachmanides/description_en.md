### A Famous Story: The Ramban and the Disputation of Barcelona

In 1263, the Ramban was summoned to Barcelona to participate in a public disputation with a Jewish convert to Christianity named Pablo Christiani. The disputation was held in the presence of King James I of Aragon, and it was a major event in the history of Jewish-Christian relations.

The Ramban was a brilliant debater, and he successfully defended Judaism against the attacks of Christiani. He argued that the messiah had not yet come, and that the Torah was still the word of God.

The Ramban's victory in the disputation was a major embarrassment for the Church, and he was forced to flee Spain. He spent the last years of his life in the Land of Israel, where he wrote his famous commentary on the Torah.

This story illustrates the Ramban's courage and his unwavering commitment to the truth. It is a testament to his belief that the Torah is the word of God and that it is the ultimate source of wisdom and guidance.
