Rabbi Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter, also known as the Sfat Emet, was the third Rebbe of the Ger Hasidic dynasty. He was one of the most influential Hasidic leaders in Poland in the late 19th century.

His teachings, published under the title Sfat Emet, are known for their depth, originality, and profound insights into the weekly Torah portion and the Jewish holidays. The Sfat Emet is a classic of Hasidic literature and is studied by Hasidim and non-Hasidim alike. He was also a major force in the religious and communal life of Polish Jewry.

### A Famous Story: The Sfat Emet and the Two Prayers

The Sfat Emet was known for his intense and emotional prayer. Once, a hasid came to him and said, "Rebbe, I have a problem. I am a simple man, and I do not know how to pray. I can say the words, but I do not feel anything."

The Sfat Emet answered, "There are two kinds of prayer. There is the prayer of the mind, and there is the prayer of the heart. The prayer of the mind is when you understand the words you are saying. The prayer of the heart is when you feel the words you are saying.

"Both are important," the Sfat Emet continued. "But the prayer of the heart is more important. For it is the prayer of the heart that ascends to the heavens and brings down blessings from above."

The hasid was very moved by the Sfat Emet's words. He went home and began to pray with all his heart, and he found that his prayers were answered.

This story illustrates the Sfat Emet's teaching that the most important thing in prayer is not the words you say, but the intention of your heart. It is a testament to his belief that even the simplest person can connect to God through sincere and heartfelt prayer.
