**Born:** 1720, Sielec, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (today Belarus)
**Died:** 1797, Vilnius, Russian Empire (today Lithuania)

Rabbi Eliyahu ben Shlomo Zalman Kremer, known as the Vilna Gaon or the Gra, was a towering figure in Jewish intellectual life. He was a Talmudist, Halakhist, Kabbalist, and the foremost leader of mitnagdic (non-Hasidic) Jewry of his time.

He is famous for his encyclopedic knowledge of all of Jewish literature, his photographic memory, and his unique method of textual analysis. His annotations and emendations of the Talmud and other works are considered authoritative. Though he did not publish any books himself, his teachings were recorded by his students and have had a lasting impact on Jewish scholarship.

### A Famous Story: The Vilna Gaon and the Maggid of Dubno

The Vilna Gaon was a very private person, and he did not like to waste his time on idle chatter. Once, the Maggid of Dubno, a famous preacher, came to Vilna and asked to see the Gaon.

The Gaon's students were reluctant to admit him, but the Maggid was persistent. He said, "I have a very important message for the Gaon."

Finally, the students relented and let him in. The Maggid entered the Gaon's study and said, "I have come to tell you a story."

The Gaon said, "I do not have time for stories."

The Maggid said, "This is a very short story. It is about a king who had a precious diamond. He wanted to have it cut, so he sent for the best diamond cutter in the kingdom. The diamond cutter came and looked at the diamond. He said, 'This is a beautiful diamond, but it has a flaw.'

"'I can cut it for you,' the diamond cutter continued, 'but I will have to cut away the flaw. And when I do, the diamond will be smaller.'

"The king said, 'I do not care how small it is. I want it to be perfect.'

"So the diamond cutter cut the diamond, and it was smaller, but it was perfect.

"The Maggid then said to the Gaon, 'You, Gaon, are the king. The diamond is the Torah. And I am the diamond cutter. I have come to help you cut away the flaws in your understanding of the Torah, so that it will be perfect.'"

The Gaon was very impressed by the Maggid's story. He said, "You are a wise man. Please, tell me more."

This story illustrates the Vilna Gaon's humility and his willingness to learn from others, even from those who were not as learned as he was. It is a testament to his belief that the Torah is a living and breathing thing, and that there is always more to learn.
